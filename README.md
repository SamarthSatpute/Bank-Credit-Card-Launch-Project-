# Bank Credit Card Launch Project

## Project Description
This project focuses on analyzing customer data to facilitate the launch of a new credit card. It includes a two-phase approach:

1. **Phase 1**: Data analysis to identify target customer segments based on transaction history, income, and credit profiles.
2. **Phase 2**: Business insights for untapped markets, including A/B testing setup and pre-campaign analysis for effective targeting of customers aged 18-25.

The project provides actionable insights for customer segmentation and marketing strategies.

## Key Features
- Detailed customer analysis to identify target segments.
- Pre-campaign planning with A/B testing for data-driven decision-making.
- Insights into customer behavior across different demographics.
- Use of statistical methods and visualization techniques for exploratory data analysis.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - `pandas` for data manipulation.
  - `numpy` for numerical computations.
  - `seaborn` and `matplotlib` for data visualization.
  - `statsmodels` and `scipy` for statistical analysis.
- **Data Sources**: CSV and MySQL database.

## Usage
1. **Phase 1**: 
   - Analyze customer demographics and transaction data to segment the market.
   - Run the notebook `phase_1_credit_card.ipynb` to view data insights and visualizations.

2. **Phase 2**: 
   - Focus on customers aged 18-25 for targeted marketing.
   - Perform A/B testing for pre-campaign analysis using `phase_2_credit_card.ipynb`.

   Both notebooks can be run in Jupyter Notebook or similar environments. Ensure all dependencies are installed.

## Gained Insights
- Customers aged 18-25 form a significant segment (~25% of the customer base).
- This group has relatively low income and limited credit history.
- Credit card usage is minimal in this age group, with low transaction amounts.
- Popular shopping categories include Electronics, Fashion & Apparel, and Beauty & Personal Care.
